If you've got a nice script that you'd like to share, this page tells you how to do it.

## Goal

Our goal is to get a curated and maintained selection of scripts. We are particularly interested in scripts that are well described and easy for non expert users to use.

## Solution

Our solution is to host this website [on GitHub](https://github.com/FoldingText/foldingtext.github.com). That makes the site code accessible to anyone. And if you want to make a change to the site (such as submit or update a script) you can use the normal GitHub [collaborative development process](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests):

1. Fork [our repository](https://github.com/FoldingText/foldingtext.github.com).
2. Make changes in your fork.
3. Send us a pull request when you're done.

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate this site. If you are submitting a new script please use the [Archive Done Script](https://raw.github.com/FoldingText/foldingtext.github.com/master/posts/extensions/scripts/_posts/2012-11-12-archive-done-script.md) as a template. Make sure your script has a good description and please host your script code offsite in a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com).

Thanks, [let us know](http://support.foldingtext.com) if you have questions!
